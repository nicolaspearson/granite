/**
 * This required because we supply TypeORM with our entities and migrations on start-up. This can
 * either be supplied as a path to a location where TypeORM is able to locate the compiled classes
 * and functions, e.g. dist/db/entities/*.js, or we can supply the entities one-by-one in the
 * connection configuration, both options have their downsides. It is not ideal to supply a path
 * because we are compiling a single bundle, and we do not want to supply each entity and migration
 * in the connection configuration because this soon becomes unmanageable as the size of the package
 * grows.
 *
 * Webpack gives us require.context, which allows us to get all matching modules from a given
 * directory. This means we can get all of our entities and migrations automatically, and supply
 * this to TypeORM in the connection configuration instead.
